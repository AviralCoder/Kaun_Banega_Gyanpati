Welcome the KBG - Kaun Banega Gyanpati app! In this
app you will get a random question on the screen. If you
get it correct, your knowledge score will keep on
increasing but if you get it wrong, the game will stop. But never ever take a chance,
either quit or we have got 2 lifelines for you, Flip The Question lifeline - it
helps you change the question (there are 2 of these).  Remember this, you have 
only one chance to click the questions. If you click on any 
option then we will take it to be the one chosen by you, so don't
misclick! You have 60 seconds to answer each question.
If you change tabs, then we will consider it as
cheating and stop the game. You may download your score as an image if you want to.
Your difficulty will be easy at the starting of the game and will change to medium 
at 500, hard at 1500 and you win the game at 5000.  Since
this app is just a web app and has limitations, we recommend someone to physically monitor how
you play.

Welcome the KBG - Kaun Banega Gyanpati app! In this
app you will get a random question on screen, if you
get it correct, your knowledge score will keep on
increasing but if you get it wrong, the game will stop. But never ever take a chance,
either quite or we have got 2 lifelines for you, Flip The Question lifeline -
lets you change the question (there are 2 of these).  Remember this, you got 
only one chance to click the questions, if you click any 
option then we will take it to be chosen by you so don't
misclick! You have got 60 seconds to answer each question.
And yes, if you change tabs, then we will consider it as
cheating and stop the game. You may download your score as an image if you want to.
 Your difficulty will be easy at the starting of the game and will change to medium 
 at 500, hard at 1500 and you won the game at 5000.  Since
this app is just a web app, we recommend someone to monitor how
you play.

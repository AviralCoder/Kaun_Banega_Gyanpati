Welcome the KBG - Kaun Banega Gyanpati app! In this
app you will get a random question on screen, if you
get it correct, your knowledge score will keep on
increasing but if you get it wrong, it will go down
to a particular value. But never ever take a chance,
either quite or we have got 2 lifelines for you,
Google lifelinewhich gives you 15 seconds to Google
the question and Flip The Question lifeline which
lets you change the question. Remember this, you got 
only one chance to click the questions, if you click any 
option then we will take it to be chosen by you so don't
misclick! You have got 60 seconds to answer each question.
And yes, if you change tabs, then we will consider it as
cheating and we will reset your points back to 0. When you take
the Google lifeline, then you are allowed to change tabs. Since
this app is just a web app, we recommend someone to monitor how
you play.
